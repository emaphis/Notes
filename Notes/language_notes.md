Notes from Dan Grossman's Programming Languages

* Pieces of Learning a Language

** Syntax - How do you write language constructs

** Semantics - What do programs mean? (Evaluation rules)

** Idioms - What are the typical patterns of using language features

** Libraries - what facilities does the language provide

** Tools - What tools does the implementation provide 
(I.E - REPL, debugger, code formatter, IDE,...)

These are 5 separate issues.

Semantics is much more important then syntax.

Libraries and tools are important, but you most likely will learn them
on the job.
